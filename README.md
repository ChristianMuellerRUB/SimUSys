# SimUSys
System-oriented simulations of urban systems.

This repository contains the code for a platform for system-oriented simulations of urban systems (SimUSys) which was developed within the scope of a PhD thesis by Christian Mueller at the Ruhr University Bochum and Bochum University of Applied Sciences (Germany) in January 2019.

The application is at experimental stage and does not come with any warranties.
