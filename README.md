# SimUSys
System-oriented simulations of urban systems.

This repository contains the code for a platform for system-oriented simulations of urban systems (SimUSys) which was developed within the scope of a PhD thesis by Christian Mueller at the Ruhr University Bochum and Bochum University of Applied Sciences (Germany) in January 2019.

As SimUSys is designed as an easy-to-use application which requires no local installation, it is assumed to be accessed from browsers and executed on a server with adequate computational resources (min. 64 GB RAM and 8-core processor)

The application is at experimental stage and does not come with any warranties.
